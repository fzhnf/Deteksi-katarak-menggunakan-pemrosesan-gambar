# Cataract Detection using Image Processing in Python
The tool works on two algorithms. The first algorithm is based on feature extraction. It detects the presence of cataract in the eye and classifies it as a healthy eye, eye having mild cataract or an eye with severe cataract. The second algorithm is based on area calculation and segmentation. It calculates the percentage of cataract in an unhealthy eye.
